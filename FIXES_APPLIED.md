**Files Modified**:
- `components/results-card.tsx`

**Solutions Applied**:

#### A. Results Display

**File**: `components/results-card.tsx`
```typescript
// Before:
currency: "USD"

// After:
currency: "INR"
locale: 'en-IN'
```

#### B. Form Labels
Updated all currency-related labels:

**File**: `components/roi-form.tsx`
- Line 96: `Hourly Wage ($)` → `Hourly Wage (₹)`
- Line 118: `Error Fix Cost ($)` → `Error Fix Cost (₹)`
- Line 140: `One-time Cost ($)` → `One-time Cost (₹)`

#### C. Report Generation
Updated HTML report to use ₹ symbol:

**File**: `app/api/report/generate/route.tsx`
- Line 45: Hourly Wage: `$${...}` → `₹${...}`
- Line 47: Error Cost: `$${...}` → `₹${...}`
- Line 49: One-time Cost: `$${...}` → `₹${...}`
- Line 56: Monthly Savings: `$${...}` → `₹${...}`

### ✅ Issue 3: Download Report Functionality
**Problem**: Need to verify and improve download report feature

**Solutions Applied**:

2. **Improved DOM manipulation**:
   - Append anchor element to body before clicking
   - Remove anchor element after download
3. **Added success feedback**: Alert message on successful download
4. **Added error logging**: Console error for debugging
5. **Proper cleanup**: URL.revokeObjectURL after download

**File**: `components/scenarios-panel.tsx`
```typescript
