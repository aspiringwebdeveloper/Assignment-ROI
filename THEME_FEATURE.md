## 🎯 How It Works

### Theme Provider
Wraps the entire application and manages theme state:
```tsx
<ThemeProvider
  attribute="class"
  defaultTheme="system"
  enableSystem
  disableTransitionOnChange
>
```

### Theme Toggle
Simple button that switches between light and dark:
```tsx
<ThemeToggle />
```

### CSS Variables
Automatically switches between light and dark color schemes:
- Light mode: Uses `:root` variables
- Dark mode: Uses `.dark` class variables

---

## 🎨 Color Schemes

### Light Mode
- Background: White
- Text: Dark gray
- Cards: White with subtle borders
- Buttons: Black with white text

### Dark Mode
- Background: Dark gray/black
- Text: Light gray/white
- Cards: Dark with lighter borders
- Buttons: White with dark text

## 💡 User Experience

### Automatic Features:
- ✅ **Persists preference** - Remembers choice across sessions
- ✅ **System sync** - Defaults to OS theme
- ✅ **Smooth transitions** - No jarring color changes
- ✅ **Accessible** - Screen reader friendly

### User Flow:
1. User visits site → Sees system theme (light/dark based on OS)
2. User clicks theme toggle → Switches to opposite theme
3. User refreshes page → Theme preference remembered
4. User visits on different device → Can set preference again
